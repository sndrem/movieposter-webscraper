## Movie poster scraper
Here is code for scraping [IMP Awards](http://www.impawards.com/). //www.impawards.com/).

This is how you run the program

1. Have MySQL running on your machine
2. Create a database with the name: movieposters
3. Run the sql-file and create the correct table.
4. Add JSoup and MySql-connector as dependencies
5. Run the program. It takes some time to extract 30 000 posters, so go make yourself a cup of coffee in the meantime
