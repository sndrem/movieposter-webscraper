## Movie poster scraper
Here is code for scraping [IMP Awards](http://www.impawards.com/).

If you only want the finished extracted triples, after we have added semantics to the data, just go ahead and use posters.ttl.

This is how you run the program

1. Have MySQL running on your machine
2. Create a database with the name: movieposters
3. Run the sql-file and create the correct table.
4. Add JSoup and MySql-connector as dependencies
5. Run the program. It takes some time to extract 30 000 posters, so go make yourself a cup of coffee in the meantime
